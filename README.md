# Open-Data-Lab

## Contact: uva-dsi-opendatalab-request@virginia.edu

## Introduction
The Open Data Lab is an initiative spearheaded by the Data Science Institute at the University of Virginia. Partner organizations include: the UVA library, the Center for Open Science, and the Public Library of Science. 

Goals:
* Reference Data - Provision of a large corpus of open research and other data (CC0) and associated analytics (OSI-approved licence) across disciplines to be an exemplar for the representation of open structured and unstructured reference data.
* Training - Use the reference data and analytics to train the next generation of data scientists and raise literacy around data at UVA and elsewhere.
* Reproducibility - Facilitate scientific reproducibility through execution of workflows associated with the data and analytics.
* Productivity - Science is currently a highly inefficient process. Provision of public executable workflows can accelerate the process.
* Public engagement - Open data exploration pipelines based on open data are a powerful means to engage with the broader public, both around open data and data science in general and the issues that they can help address.
* Broad Recognition - as a valuable community resource.

Currently we are in closed beta testing. If you are interested in the project please watch us on github and email uva-dsi-opendatalab-request@virginia.edu.

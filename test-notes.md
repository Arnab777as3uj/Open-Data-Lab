# About

Notes taken while Pete explains the system to Daniel on Oct 18, 2018.


# Steps

- Choose a project to work on
  - Look into ORCID dumps https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/ideas/issues/861
- Get users (example: DM) the ability to log into the ODL system
  - Pete creates a bucket for the data
    - has the code ODL-XXXX, where XXXX stands for some identifier
  - Pete creates a group with permissions for everyone who's going to be part of the project
  - Pete creates the users within the group
  - Pete sends link to console to the new users, with temporary password
  - user logs in and sets a new password
- Pete creates a computer for the user(s)
  - computer can only be seen if user is logged in to the correct region (N. Virginia for DSI)
- when logged in, search under Services for "SageMaker"
- under SageMaker, click on "Notebook instances" in the left sidebar
- users pick their XXXX project from the list
  - hitting "Open" opens a Jupyter notebook ready to be run
